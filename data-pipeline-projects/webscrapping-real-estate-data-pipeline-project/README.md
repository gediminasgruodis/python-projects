# Real Estate Prices Data Pipeline

<b>Project goal:</b> Create data a pipeline that extracts data from the Lithuanian real estate listings site www.Domusplius.lt.

<b>Project value:</b> The tool allows for gathering real estate pricing data fast and in real time. On top of that, the pipeline cleans the data, adds additional calculations and stores it in a database. Later this data can be used for simple economic analysis or for ML solution creation.

<b>Using the project:</b> The project could be used out of the box or with simple additional changes - I have already preselected Vilnius as the main city on the website, hence if you would like to download prices for other Lithuanian cities, you would need to tailor current web request to your preference.
   Also, you would need to specify the database login details, in case you want to store this data in a database.
